    title: Log Metric Filter And Alert Should Notify On Route Changes
    description: |
      A metric filter and alert should exist for VPC network route changes. Monitoring changes 
      to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path.
    remediation: |-
      Create a [logging metric](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics) with the following
      advanced filter:

      ```
      resource.type="gce_route"
        AND jsonPayload.event_subtype="compute.routes.delete" 
        OR jsonPayload.event_subtype="compute.routes.insert"
      ```

      In the Metric Editor menu, fill out the `name` field. Set `Units` to `1` (default)
      and `Type` to `Counter`. This will ensure that the log metric counts the number
      of log entries matching the user's advanced logs query.

      Next, [Create an alert from the Metric](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics) with
      an alert threshold of `0` to trigger a notification every time route tables are changed.
    validation: |-
      List the log metrics.

      ```
      gcloud beta logging metrics list --format json
      ```

      Ensure that the output contains at least one metrics with the filter:

      ```
      resource.type="gce_route"
        AND jsonPayload.event_subtype="compute.routes.delete"
        OR jsonPayload.event_subtype="compute.routes.insert"
      ```

      List the alerting policies.

      ```
      gcloud alpha monitoring policies list --format json
      ```

      Ensure that at least one alert policy has `conditions.conditionThreshold.filter`
      set to `metric.type="logging.googleapis.com/user/<Log Metric Name>"` and `enabled` set to `true`.
